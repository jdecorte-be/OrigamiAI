You've done a great job! This is a classic "bird base" or "crane base" in origami that is often used as a starting point for many models including the crane. The open flaps are positioned at the bottom, and there are two closed flaps at the top, which will become the crane's wings. The open end, where the four flaps divide, is where you'll form the head and tail. You're on the right track! Keep going!
