You've made great progress! You're currently at the preliminary base or square base stage of the origami crane. You've successfully created the initial folds that form a smaller square with the open ends facing down towards you. The color pattern looks symmetric with dual shades facing upwards. Great job getting to this point! Now you're ready to move onto the next stepâ€”creating the bird base. Keep going, you're doing wonderfully!
