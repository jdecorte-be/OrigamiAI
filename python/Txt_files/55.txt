You're doing great! Your origami crane is in the "bird base" form, which serves as a foundation for many origami birds, including the crane. The top of the figure has two thin points that will become the crane's tail and head, and two wider points below that will form the wings. The center crease is helping you align the shape symmetrically. Keep up the good work!
