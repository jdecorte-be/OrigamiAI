The image you provided shows that you have made an incorrect diagonal fold. The correct step at this stage of the origami crane would be to create a square base, which involves folding the paper diagonally both ways and horizontally both ways to create creases, then collapsing the model along those creases to form a square shape (also known as a preliminary fold). Here are the issues with your current folding:

1. You have folded the paper into a single diagonal fold from corner to corner, which is typically only the first of several folds needed to create a square base.

2. You haven't performed the second diagonal fold, which should go from the opposite corners.

To proceed correctly:

- Unfold the paper to a full square.
- Fold it diagonally in the other direction as well, creating an "X" crease pattern.
- Turn the paper over and fold it in half top to bottom and then left to right, to create a "taco" shape and then a flat rectangle.
- With the creases in place, open it slightly and collapse it along the creases into the square base, making sure all points are aligned and creases are crisp.

Once you have the square base, you will be in a position to carry on with the following steps of the crane.
