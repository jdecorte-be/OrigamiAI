Well done on your progress so far! You have completed your origami crane successfully. It stands with the wings neatly folded out on either side, and the head and tail pointed in opposite directions. The crane's body is centered between the wings, with the traditional bird base structure evident. The head has the typical single fold creating the beak of the crane - a signature feature of origami cranes. Keep practicing to make your cranes even sharper!
