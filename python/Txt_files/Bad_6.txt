The primary issue here is that the "legs" or "wings" (pointed flaps) of the crane are not symmetrically aligned; one is pointing straight up while the other is folded out to the side. In this step, both legs should ideally be positioned in the same direction (either both up or both down), preparing for the subsequent steps where they will be folded to become the wings and tail of the crane.

To correct this:

1. Unfold the one leg that is pointing up.
2. Align it with the other leg so that they are both pointing in the same direction.
3. Ensure that the folds are crisp and even to maintain symmetry.

This should prepare you for the next folding steps in creating your origami crane, which will involve shaping the wings, tail, and head.
