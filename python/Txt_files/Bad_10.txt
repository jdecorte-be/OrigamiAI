The folds on your origami crane appear to be incorrect. Hereâ€™s what you should correct:

1. The top flap does not fully extend to a point, which is essential for creating the crane's head and tail. It should be sharply pointed.

2. The green lines indicated at the bottom wing flaps show that they are not symmetrical. Both wings must be evenly folded across the central vertical line for symmetry.

3. The bottom of the crane, marked with red dots, suggests that the folds are not meeting at the centerline. Both lower edges should align precisely at the center for a clean, straight fold, contributing to the stability of the crane's base.

Please ensure all folds are crisp, precise, and symmetrical for the best results in origami.
