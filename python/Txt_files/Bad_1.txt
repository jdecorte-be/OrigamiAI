It appears that you have unfolded the paper completely after doing some previous folds. Based on the crease pattern on your paper, you should have:

1. Kept the paper folded into a smaller square with the colored side outside.
2. Created a "squash fold" to flatten the upper layers into a square shape, which is not properly executed in the photo shown. 

Remember to always keep your creases sharp and follow the steps without unfolding unless instructed. Please revisit the previous steps to ensure you reach this stage with the correct folds in place.
