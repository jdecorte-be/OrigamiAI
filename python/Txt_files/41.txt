Great job so far! You have completed what's commonly known as the "square base" or "preliminary base" in origami, which consists of two diagonal valley folds that intersect at the center of the model, and you've folded the edges to meet at the center line, forming a smaller, square-like shape with open flaps at the bottom. This structure is the foundation upon which we'll build the crane. Keep up the good work! Now you're ready to proceed to the next steps, where you'll start shaping the wings, neck, and tail of the crane.
