Well done getting this far! In this step, you have what's known as the "bird base" â€“ a key form in origami that's often used as a starting point for various models, including the crane. Your paper is currently folded into a smaller square with two flaps sticking up, which will become the wings. The open part of the square is facing towards you, and you're likely in the midst of creating the crane's neck and tail. Keep up the good work!
