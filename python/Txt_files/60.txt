You've done well! You have a kite-shaped base with a vertical crease down the middle. The bottom part of the "kite" is folded upwards, and the top layer of the bottom corners is folded up diagonally to meet the top point, creating a diamond shape with two "legs" at the bottom. You're making great progress. Now, you'll need to turn the piece over and repeat the steps to match this side. Keep going!
