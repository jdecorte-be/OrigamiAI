The photo you provided shows that you've made incorrect foldings which deviate from the typical steps required for an origami crane. The paper should not have disjointed sections and asymmetrical fold lines. 

Here's a step you have done incorrectly:
- The right section of paper should not protrude outwards like that. It appears you've made an errant fold along what should have been a straight edge.

To correct this, you need to ensure that each fold is crisp and aligns with the corresponding edges or crease lines to maintain symmetry. It's crucial to start with a square base and make precise folds following the crease pattern usually employed in crane folding. Revisit the previous steps to ensure accuracy before proceeding.
