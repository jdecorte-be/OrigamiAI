You have done a great job so far! You've got the basic bird base shape, which is the foundation for the origami crane. You have it standing with the open part at the bottom, which is exactly where it should be. The two legs that will become the wings are pointing upwards, and the narrower parts that will form the head and tail of the crane are vertical and centered. Keep going, you're on the right track!
