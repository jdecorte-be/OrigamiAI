You've done a great job so far! You have completed the preliminary fold and have a right triangle shape. The hypotenuse side is on the bottom and the right angle corner is at the top left. The folded edge is on the right and the open edge is on the left. Now, you will need to create a square base to continue to the next steps. Keep up the great work!
