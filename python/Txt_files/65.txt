Great job so far! You have a "bird base" in front of you. It's a common base in origami used for creating various bird models, including the crane.

From this position, the next step is to fold the wings down, which will form the crane's wings and reveal the head and tail. Remember to make your folds crisp and precise. Keep up the good work!
