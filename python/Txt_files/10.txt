You are currently at the step where you have folded the paper diagonally into a triangle, with the colored or patterned side facing up. You are pressing down the fold to create a strong crease. Great job getting to this stage! Now, you're ready for the next step where you'll fold the triangle in half by bringing the bottom corner to the top corner. Keep going; you're doing fantastic!
