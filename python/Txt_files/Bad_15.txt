The image you've provided shows several issues with the origami crane folding steps:

1. There should not be any visible loose flaps or layers separating from each other. The paper should be neatly folded without any parts coming undone.
2. The tip of what should be the crane's head or tail is unfolded and splayed open, whereas it should be neatly pointed with the inside layers not visible.
3. It seems that the overall shape is not symmetrical, with one side appearing bulkier than the other. Symmetry is crucial in origami for the final shape to look correct.

Please recheck the folds for neatness and symmetry, and make sure that the head/tail tip is properly folded and pointed.
