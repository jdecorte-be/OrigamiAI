That's a great start! You have folded your paper into a double-sided, elongated diamond shape, with one end having two separate points which will become the crane's tail and head. You're holding the model in a manner which displays two thin legs on each side which will become the wings. The top layers of each side are ready to be folded to shape the head and tail of the crane. Keep going; you're doing well!
