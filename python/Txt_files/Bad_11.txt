It appears you've made a mistake with the "petal fold" step commonly used in making a crane. The lower part of the paper is not supposed to extend upwards as much as you have done; it should only come up to create a diamond shape. Here's where you went wrong:

1. The top corner of the diamond (where your lips are) should not be lifted up that high. It should stay down at the base level to form the top of the diamond.

2. The side edges marked with lines should meet in the center line vertically, not cross it; this will create a proper kite shape with the top point of the paper forming the top of the kite.

3. The bottom point (beneath your chin) should not be folded upward. It should be forming the bottom point of the kite, inline with the top point.

Unfold the paper slightly and try to align the edges neatly so that they meet in the center vertically, and the top and bottom points align to form a diamond or kite shape without extending beyond that central vertical line.
