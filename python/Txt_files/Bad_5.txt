The origami crane folding here has several errors:

1. The upper layer's point does not lie exactly at the bottom intersection point, which is essential for correct symmetry.
2. The left and right sides of the upper layer should be folded inward to meet at the vertical center line, creating a kite shape on top.
3. It seems that an incorrect fold was made from the bottom side, protruding up, which doesn't match any standard step in creating an origami crane.

Please unfold the incorrect parts and ensure that each fold is precise and sharp, and that symmetry is maintained at all times for the proper shape.
