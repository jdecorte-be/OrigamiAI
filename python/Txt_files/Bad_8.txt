I'm sorry, but it appears there has been a misunderstanding. The image you have sent is of a person lying on a yoga mat covered with a blue blanket, which does not pertain to origami or paper folding. Please ensure you are sending an actual step or image related to your origami crane. If you have a diagram or instructions from the origami tutorial you're following, please share that for guidance on the correct steps to take.
