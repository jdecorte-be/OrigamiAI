The image shows a paper with a series of incorrect folds. Here are the mistakes:

1. The paper should not be folded into a asymmetrical shape; it appears that one side of your paper is wider than the other.
2. The top corner of the model, which will become the head and tail of the crane, is not aligned to the center, creating an uneven shape.
3. The bottom of the model, which forms the crane's body, looks uneven with unequal angles on the sides.

Please ensure that all folds are symmetrical and aligned correctly to form the traditional crane shape.
