The paper is not folded correctly for a standard origami crane step. Here are the issues:

1. Unnecessary diagonal fold: There is a diagonal fold across the paper that does not belong in the crane-making steps.
2. Incorrect orientation: The base of the paper should be a square shape, with both the open parts and the folded edge at the bottom.
3. Incorrect creases: The creases do not form the preliminary base (square base) needed for the crane, which is a series of valley and mountain folds that allow you to collapse the model into a smaller square.

Please correct these steps to move forward with your crane. Start with a square piece of paper, make the proper valley and mountain folds to achieve the preliminary base, and then proceed to collapse the model into the square base, ensuring the open end is at the bottom and the folded edge is at the top.
