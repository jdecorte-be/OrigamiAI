You're doing great! This is the 'bird base', which is a common starting point for many origami birds, including the crane. The top of the model is where the bird's head and tail will be formed, while the two lower flaps will become the wings. Keep up the good work â€“ you're about midway through the steps. Next, you'll work on shaping the head, tail, and wings of your crane.
