You are at a great starting point! It looks like you have just finished a square base or preliminary fold, which is typically after making the diagonal and book folds necessary for a crane. You have opened one flap and made a crease, forming what will become one of the crane's legs. The top layers are folded down to align with the center crease, and it looks like you're holding one flap out to the side, getting ready for the next step. Keep going, youâ€™re on your way to creating a beautiful crane!
