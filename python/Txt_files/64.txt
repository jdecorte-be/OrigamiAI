You've done a great job reaching this step! You're currently at the 'petal fold' stage: one of the key steps in creating your origami crane. It looks like you have just completed the petal folds on one side. This is where the paper is opened up at the top and the sides are folded inward along existing creases, then the flap at the top is folded down to create a diamond shape with two extended points (which will become the wings). The next step is to repeat this petal fold on the other side to mirror what you have done here. Keep up the good work!
