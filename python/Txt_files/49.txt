You've done a great job so far! You are currently at what is known as the "kite base" which is often used in origami and serves as the foundation for many models, including the crane. Your paper is folded into a small diamond shape with the open end at the bottom and the closed end at the top, with a vertical crease running down the center. Keep up the good work! Next, you'll be making the bird base, which is a key step towards creating the crane's distinctive shape.
