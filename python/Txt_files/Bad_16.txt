It appears you are holding the model incorrectly for the step you are at. You need to gently pull the layers apart at the top corners, not forcefully as your grip suggests. The fingers should be placed at the edges for gentle guidance, not pinching the paper. Ensure you are creating precise and soft folds to maintain the integrity of the paper and the form of the crane.
