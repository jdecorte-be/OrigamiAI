You're doing great! You have already created a "square base" which is one of the essential bases in origami. This base is also known as a "preliminary base." Your paper is colored on one side and patterned on the other, with the colored side facing out. It looks like all your creases are sharp and accurate, which is key in origami. Keep up the good work â€“ you're on the right track to achieving a beautiful crane!
