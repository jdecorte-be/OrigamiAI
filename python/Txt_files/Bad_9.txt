It seems like you have misaligned your folds. The left section that is sticking out should be tucked in to create a narrower diamond shape. This is likely the result of not aligning the edges properly in a previous step:

1. The middle crease of your square base should be aligned precisely to ensure accuracy in subsequent folds.
2. When folding the sides into the center line to create the kite shape, the edges need to meet at the center without overlapping or leaving gaps.
3. Ensure when you make the horizontal fold that brings the lower point of the paper up to the top point, it should be crisp and precise to make sure your sides align correctly in the next steps.

Revisit the steps before this one to correct the misalignment and proceed with a well-aligned diamond shape for your crane.
