You're at a great point! Your paper is folded into what's called a "kite base" or "ice-cream cone shape". There are two flaps on each side and your paper has a sharp point at the bottom, which will form the tail of the crane. The open part is at the top where you're holding, ready for the next folds. Keep up the good work!
