It appears you've incorrectly folded the wings of the crane downwards instead of leaving them pointing upwards. The "legs" of the crane, which should be the two points sticking out from the bottom of the body, seem to be confused with the wings. To correct this:

1. Unfold the two flaps currently pointing downwards to bring them back to a horizontal position, in line with the crane's body.
2. Review the previous steps to correctly identify the top (wings) and bottom (legs) parts of the origami figure. The wings should fold downwards only slightly to give them a realistic appearance, not be aligned with the bottom of the figure.
